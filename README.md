# Description

OctoSpork aims to create an intuitive, centralized area to access information
regarding public servants representing a user

# Installation

To run a local instance of this server, simply clone the repo, run
`npm install` to install dependencies and `npm run start` to build
and start a local server or `npm run dev` to start the server directly
from the `src` files (useful for debugging)

providing endpoints that can be used by any FE or REST client

# Contributing

If you'd like to contribute, visit our `issues` tab to either

use a [trunk-based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) approach and do not permit
direct pushes to `main` so please open a PR for any proposed
improvements
